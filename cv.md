[**Pet Project**(still in progress)](http://doctorsearch.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/): 
I develop a web application that assists patients in finding the right doctor. The project was built with ReactJS, React Router, React Context, HTML, and SASS and was deployed on AWS S3 using AWS Lambda for improved performance.The project also utilized Amazon Amplify for authentication. In this project users can search for doctors based on their specific needs and preferences, read reviews and ratings, and find the perfect match. My skills that are introduced in this app will be valuable assets to future projects.

I have completed numerous courses and engaged in extensive practice, mastering various technologies such as HTML, CSS, SASS, ES6, JavaScript, React, React Router, Styled Components, and Redux. I am also familiar with Bootstrap, JQuery, SQL, Figma, Postman, Node.js, AWS Amplify, and AWS Lambda.

#### **CODE EXAMPLE:**
The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.


```
function duplicateEncode(word){
    let result = word.toLowerCase().split("").map((l, index, arr) => {
      let firstIndex = arr.indexOf(l);
      let lastIndex = arr.lastIndexOf(l);
      if (firstIndex === lastIndex) {
        return "("
      } else {
          return ")"
        }
      
    }).join("");
    return result;
